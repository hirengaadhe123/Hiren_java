//â€¢ Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and 
//two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its 
//constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize the length 
//and breadth of the rectangle. Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its 
//constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the constructor of its 
//parent class as 'super (s, s)'. Print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square.
